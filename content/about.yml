  Hi, I'm **Arthur Dufour**, a full-stack web developer with a passion for crafting seamless, performant web applications. I specialize in building both front-end and back-end solutions, with a particular love for **NuxtJS** on the front-end and **AdonisJS** on the back-end. 
  My journey in web development began with a curiosity for how websites work under the hood. Since then, I've dedicated myself to mastering the tools and frameworks that make building scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly applications possible. I enjoy tackling both the creative challenges of UI design and the logical puzzles of server-side programming.

  ### My Development Philosophy

  I believe in **clean code**, **efficient architecture**, and **user-first design**. For me, great web applications are the result of thoughtful planning, attention to detail, and iterative improvement. Whether it's building a responsive NuxtJS front-end or designing robust APIs with AdonisJS, I strive to create solutions that are both elegant and practical.

  ### What Drives Me

  The ever-evolving landscape of web development keeps me excited. I love experimenting with new technologies, optimizing performance, and turning complex requirements into simple, intuitive user experiences. Seeing an idea come to life on the web and knowing it works smoothly for users is what motivates me every day.

  ### Beyond the Code

  Outside of coding, you might find me exploring the latest web development trends, contributing to open-source projects, or enjoying time outdoors to recharge my creativity.
