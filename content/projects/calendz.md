As a fullstack developer, every project I work on holds a special place in my heart, but none compare to Calendz—my first complete web application. Built during my student years, it wasn't just a technical endeavor but also a deeply personal project that taught me invaluable lessons in development, problem-solving, and user experience.

### The Idea Behind Calendz
It all started with frustration. My school's agenda was anything but practical. It was slow, unresponsive, and felt like it was stuck in the past (I later discovered that the web application generating it was created in 1998). I knew there had to be a better way, so I decided to create one. That's how Calendz was born—a modern, responsive, and efficient alternative to our school's agenda system.

### Tech Stack and Development Journey
I opted for a robust tech stack that included:

- **Vue.js** for a sleek, interactive frontend.
- **Node.js** for handling server-side logic.
- **MongoDB** for flexible and scalable data storage.
- **Redis** for lightning-fast caching and background updates.
- **Docker** to ensure consistent and portable deployment.

This combination not only empowered me to create a responsive and fast application but also taught me the intricacies of fullstack development. From setting up authentication and learning about CI/CD pipelines to deploying on a VPS, every step was a learning curve that contributed to my growth as a developer.

### Web Scraping and Background Updates
The core of Calendz was its ability to replicate the school's agenda while improving its performance. I developed an API that used web scraping to pull data from the original system, stored it in Redis for quick access, and updated it seamlessly in the background. This approach drastically reduced load times (*from ~12s to 10ms! ⚡️*) and ensured users always had the latest information at their fingertips.

### From a School Tool to 1000+ Daily Users
What started as a tool for my classmates quickly gained traction. Word spread, and before I knew it, Calendz was being used by over 1000 students daily! Watching something I built become an integral part of others' routines was incredibly rewarding and made all the late nights worth it.

### Why I Love Calendz
Calendz is more than just an application to me—it's a symbol of my journey into fullstack development. It challenged me to think critically, write efficient code, and prioritize user experience. It wasn't perfect, but every bug I fixed and feature I added taught me something new.

### Looking Back and Moving Forward
Calendz wasn't just a project; it was my gateway into the world of professional development. The skills I gained—both technical and personal—continue to shape my work today. While I've moved on to new challenges, Calendz remains a reminder of where it all began and why I love building applications that make a difference.

If you're a budding developer wondering whether you should take on that "too big" idea—go for it. You might just create something amazing.
