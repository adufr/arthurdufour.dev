Gitify is one of my favorite application, I use it everyday and I'm very excited to share it with you!

### What is it?

Are you overwhelmed by GitHub notifications? Too many emails clogging up your inbox? Gitify is here to make your life simpler. This lightweight app sits conveniently in your menu bar, keeping you updated on GitHub notifications without overwhelming youâ€”or showing ads. It's simple, effective, and gets the job done.

Built with React and packaged in Electron, Gitify is a cross-platform application available on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

### My contribution

I had the privilege of contributing to this project, adding features such as:

- A setting to display the notification count directly in the menu bar
- The ability to mark notifications as "Done" with a single click
- A GUI scaling option for a more customizable experience
- A keyboard shortcut to quickly show or hide the app
- Various internal refactors and bug fixes
