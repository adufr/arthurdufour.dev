As a fullstack developer, I'm always on the lookout for tools that can simplify my workflow. One such tool that has become indispensable to me is [Gitify](https://gitify.io/).

Today, I'd like to share a bit about this open-source project and how I've contributed to it.

### What is Gitify?

Gitify is an open-source application designed to help developers manage their GitHub notifications more efficiently.

- It lives in your menubar and provides instant access to GitHub notifications without needing to open your browser.
- You can read, filter, and act on notifications.
- It's cross-platform, running on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- Built with React and Electron, on top of GitHub's REST and GraphQL APIs.

### Why I Use Gitify Daily
Real-time notifications are crucial for my workflow, especially to speed up pull request merges. Since GitHub doesn't offer push notifications (other than email), Gitify fills this gap perfectly. It lets me handle notifications instantly from the menubar, saving time by avoiding repeated trips to the GitHub website.

### My Contributions to Gitify
Open-source projects thrive when developers collaborate, and I'm proud to have contributed the following features to Gitify:

- **Notification Count in the Menubar:**
A handy setting that displays the number of unread notifications directly in the menubar, giving users an at-a-glance view.

- **"Mark as Done" Button:**
When I started contributing, the app was outdated with GitHub's API, which limited its functionality. I updated Gitify to use the latest API features and introduced a "Mark as Done" button.

- **GUI Scaling Option:**
Accessibility is key. I added the ability to scale the app's interface, making it more comfortable for users with different screen sizes or vision needs.

- **Keyboard Shortcut:**
To boost productivity, I implemented a shortcut that allows users to quickly show or hide the app, reducing reliance on mouse navigation.

- **Bug fixes and refactors:**
I fixed a few bugs and streamlined the codebase with internal refactors.

### Why Contributing Matters
Working on Gitify has been an enriching experience, allowing me to:
- **Learn:** Diving into a React and Electron project was an opportunity to expand my skills.
- **Give Back:** Open-source projects have helped me tremendously, and contributing to Gitify was a chance to support a tool I value.

### Final Thoughts
Gitify has not only improved how I manage my GitHub notifications but also allowed me to grow as a developer by contributing meaningful features to an open-source project. If you're a developer looking to streamline your GitHub workflow, I highly recommend giving Gitify a try.
