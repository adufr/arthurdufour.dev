Hybri is one of those projects where I had a spark of an idea, dove into implementing it, and then, as it often happens, moved on to something else ðŸ˜…

I built it during the COVID pandemic to tackle a recurring issue my company faced: keeping track of everyone's availability and location. Was someone working remotely? On-site? On vacation? On sick leave? Without an efficient system, this information was hard to organize, so I decided to create Hybri.

The idea was simple: a web app where team members could log in, update their status, and provide a centralized view of everyone's availability. Although the project was never fully completed, I deployed it within the company, and it was a hit with everyone!

Why? Because it was one of the first projects I built using [AdonisJS](https://adonisjs.com/), a framework I quickly came to enjoy for its simplicity, structured, and batteries-included approach.

Sometimes, it's not about finishing the projectâ€”it's about what you learn along the way.
