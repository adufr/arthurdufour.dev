## Enhancing Spotify with Spicetify extensions ðŸŽ¶

As a fullstack developer who spends about 8 hours a day immersed in music, I'm always on the lookout for ways to enhance my listening experience. Music is a constant companion throughout my day.

Naturally, as someone who loves to optimize and tinker with software, I found myself exploring ways to make my Spotify experience even better. That's when I discovered [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/), a powerful tool that allows users to mod the Spotify desktop client.

### What is Spicetify?
Spicetify is an open-source tool that lets users add customizations and extensions to the Spotify desktop client. Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux, it allows you to install custom themes, modify the user interface, and add extensions that enhance the functionality of Spotify. It's the perfect playground for anyone looking to take their Spotify experience to the next level ðŸš€

### My Contributions to Spicetify
During my time with Spicetify, I created two extensions that I believe significantly improve the way we interact with the Spotify app. Let me walk you through them:

#### 1. [quick-add-to-playlist](https://github.com/adufr/spicetify-extensions#1-quick-add-to-playlist)
One of the most frequent tasks when using Spotify is adding songs to playlists (I personally have 24 playlists, with one containing over 1000 songs ðŸ¤¯).

Since I'm a bit lazy, I created a way to quickly add tracks to your existing playlists without having to go through multiple menus or rely on your mouse. It's a simple tweak, but it can save you a lot of timeâ€”especially when you're deep into discovering new music.

#### 2. [quick-add-to-queue](https://github.com/adufr/spicetify-extensions#2-quick-add-to-queue)
Spotify lacked an efficient way to add songs to the queueâ€”usually, you need to right-click, navigate menus, and then add. QuickAddToQueue streamlines this by letting you add songs with a single click. It's a small change, but that's exactly what Spicetify is all about ðŸ˜„

### Final word
You can find and install my extensions on [Spicetify's marketplace](https://github.com/spicetify/marketplace) and explore their source code in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/adufr/spicetify-extensions).
